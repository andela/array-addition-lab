#Array Addition Lab

 + You are to create a function, *`arrayAddition(arr)`* to take an array of numbers as the only argument, and return true if any combination of numbers in the array can be added up to equal the largest number in the array, otherwise return the false.
 + *For example:* if arr contains `[1, 9, 6, 15, 8]` the output should return true because _9 + 6 = 15_.
 + The conditions for this lab are as follows:
  + The array will not be empty
  + The array will not contain two of the same numbers
  + The array and may contain negative numbers.


## How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\array-addition.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


##Notes

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
